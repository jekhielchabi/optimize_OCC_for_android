Hi guys!
We need to set up some things to make sure you can build this source code:
1. You need to make sure: you guys already have installed all the sdk tool: 
- NDK
- LLDB 
- CMAKE
 
2. In this project, I have used NDK build tool to make the exclude library for the image processing. 
You guys can read this library easily by access two file in the folder "jni".

3. To understand this source code and extend or modify it, you need to learn some thing about multi
thread in android java and some type of image data format. 

Good luck! I will try to update my application to help anyone who want to develop some thing like this easily.
